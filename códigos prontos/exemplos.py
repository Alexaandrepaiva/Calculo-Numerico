    Numpy Arrays
To define an array in Python, you could use the np.array function to convert a list.
x = np.array([[1, 4, 3], [9, 2, 7]])

Find the rows, columns and the total size for array x.
x.shape
x.size

Create an array z from 1 to 2000 with an increment 1.
z = np.arange(1, 2000, 1)

Use linspace to generate an array starting at 3, ending at 9, and containing 10 elements.
np.linspace(3, 9, 10)

Generate a 3 by 5 array with all the as 0.
np.zeros((3, 5))

Generate a 5 by 3 array with all the element as 1.
np.ones((5, 3))

Compute the transpose of array b.
b.T

    Functions
Here we will introduce the most common way to define a function which can be specified using the keyword def, as showing in the following:
    def function_name(argument_1, argument_2, ...):
        '''
        Descriptive String
        '''
        # comments about the statements
        function_statements 
        
        return output_parameters (optional)
